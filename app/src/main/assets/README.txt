Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on this project. This was my first time working with MapBox

so getting to know the ins and outs took a second, but after tinkering around for a little while I came to

the conclusion that MapBox is quite powerful with much to offer.




In terms of time taken for me to fulfill this project:

MapBox offers a decent set up of docs, although a large portion of it is deprecated and has since not been

updated, because of this, I had to use the docs page as a reference and then visit the companies GitHub to

see the most recently used best practices.


The total project took about 7 hours to complete, with a good amount of that time being spent on researching

and understanding the MapBox library, I believe doing this project again with the experience gained, it

could be done a lot faster.


Once again, Thank you so much for this opportunity and I look forward to discussing this project more with

you.

Curt
